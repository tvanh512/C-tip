std::cout << x; is an output statement. It outputs the value of x (which we set to 5 in the previous statement) to the screen.
The << symbol is an operator (much like + is an operator in mathematics) called the output operator.
std::cout understands that anything sent to it via the output operator should be printed on the screen. 

<< std::endl  similar to \n ( has a little difference).

Line 6 is a new type of statement, called a return statement. 
When an executable program finishes running, the main() function sends a value back to the operating system that indicates
whether it was run successfully or not.

This particular return statement returns the value of 0 to the operating system, which means “everything went okay!”.
Non-zero numbers are typically used to indicate that something went wrong, and the program had to abort
