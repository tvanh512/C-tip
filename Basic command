std::cout << x; is an output statement. It outputs the value of x (which we set to 5 in the previous statement) to the screen.
The << symbol is an operator (much like + is an operator in mathematics) called the output operator.
std::cout understands that anything sent to it via the output operator should be printed on the screen.
