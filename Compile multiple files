Compile multiple C++ file
g++ -o prog file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp

When include a custom header need to compile both:
g++ -o main main.cpp add.cpp

add.h:
// This is start of the header guard.  ADD_H can be any unique name.  By convention, we use the name of the header file.
#ifndef ADD_H
#define ADD_H
 
// This is the content of the .h file, which is where the declarations go
int add(int x, int y); // function prototype for add.h -- don't forget the semicolon!
 
// This is the end of the header guard
#endif
In order to use this header file in main.cpp, we have to include it.

main.cpp that includes add.h:
#include <iostream>
#include "add.h"
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "The sum of 3 and 4 is " << add(3, 4) << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
add.cpp stays the same:

int add(int x, int y)
{
    return x + y;
}
