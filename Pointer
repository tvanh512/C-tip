Dereferencing pointers

Once we have a pointer variable pointing at something, the other common thing to do with it is dereference the pointer
to get the value of what itâ€™s pointing at. A dereferenced pointer evaluates to the contents of the address it is pointing to.
int value = 5;
std::cout << &value; // prints address of value
std::cout << value; // prints contents of value
 
int *ptr = &value; // ptr points to value
std::cout << ptr; // prints address held in ptr, which is &value
std::cout << *ptr; // dereference ptr (get the value that ptr is pointing to)
The above program prints:

0012FF7C
5
0012FF7C
5
